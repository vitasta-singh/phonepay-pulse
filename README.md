Project :  
Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration:A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly  

Technologies:  
Github Cloning, Python, Pandas, MySQL, mysql-connector-python, Streamlit, and Plotly.  
  
  Problem:  
  1. Extract data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository through scripting and
clone it

2. Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning
and pre-processing steps.

3. Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and
retrieval.

4. Create a live geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python
to display the data in an interactive and visually appealing manner.
5. Fetch the data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard.
6. Provide at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different
facts and figures to display on the dashboard.


  Procedure:  
  
 1.Data extraction: Clone the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in a suitable format such as CSV or JSON.

2.Data transformation: Use a scripting language such as Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This may include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.

3.Database insertion: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands. Preview

4.Dashboard creation: Use the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo map functions can be used to display the data on a map and Streamlit can be used to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.

5.Data retrieval: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Use the data in the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.

6.Deployment: Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Test the solution thoroughly and deploy the dashboard publicly, making it accessible to users.

7.The result of this project will be a live geo visualization dashboard that displays information and insights from the Phonepe pulse Github repository in an interactive and visually appealing manner.
